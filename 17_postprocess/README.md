# Postprocess

![image](../docs/postprocess.png)

## What I did

- Built a small playground of post‑processing effects with React Three Fiber
- Switched effects via Leva controls to compare parameters interactively
- Implemented a “natural light” scene combining SMAA, Bloom, God Rays and DoF
- Added examples for Chromatic Aberration, Glitch, Dot Screen, Grid, Pixelation, Vignette and more
