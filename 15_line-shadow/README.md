# Line Shadow

![image](../docs/colored_shadow.gif)

## What I did

- Created a capsule mesh that blends multiple deformation modes with `three-custom-shader-material`
- Crafted a colored shadow line by projecting the directional light inside the fragment shader
- Animated the camera orbit to emphasize the shifting light and shadow contrast

## Inspiration and References

- [THREE CustomShaderMaterial](https://github.com/FarazzShaikh/THREE-CustomShaderMaterial)

## Try this out
